# AndroidExperiments

This is my playground repository for any and all android experiments I create
and I think are worth sharing.

**MVVMTemplate**

I've created this project to get familiar with some of android's architecture components and the latest Dagger2 way of doing dependency injection on android. Libraries used: Dagger2, Timber, Butterknife

**TraktClient**

I will use TraktClient to play around with Google's Room sqlite wrapper. I am especially interested in finding out how to deal with composed objects and multi table queries and the resulting performance of the queries.
